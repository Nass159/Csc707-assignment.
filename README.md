1. i included a navbar in all my pages for easy navigation and to beautify my pages,
 and went along with a simple layout because this will allow the user to understand what
the pages are about.

2. my color choices were choosen because of the images i chose to include in the pages. 

3. the first challenge i faced was how i was going to use css, 
am i going to use inline or link my html to another css document.
And the second challenge i faced was the size of the images i used.
the third challenge i faces was the format of the firstvideo i used which was "MOV"
 was not supported by all web browsers i had to look for another video with different format.
4. another challenge i faced was not being able to upload a video i used on my second web page, could not
 upload it here on GitHub because it was not less than 25mb.
